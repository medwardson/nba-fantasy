Back-end for the NBA Stats discord bot made for newhacks. Currently being hosted on Heroku! The discord bot front-end can be found here: [Discord Bot Python Section](https://github.com/benlabonte/NBA-Stat-Bot-)

Can be used to return a player's id, name, current stats, team, and jersey #, by sending a request to 'https://peaceful-hamlet-39904.herokuapp.com/player/{$first}%20{$last$}' (using proper title case).
